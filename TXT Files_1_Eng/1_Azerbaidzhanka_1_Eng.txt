1. Country and population
The Azerbaijan Socialist Soviet Republic (ASSR) was formed from 2 provinces: b. The Russian Empire — the Baku and Elizabeth-Polish; from the south it directly borders with Persia, while the Turkish border runs extremely close to it. Azerbaijan, therefore, is a border member of our Union, bordering with two states of the Near East, on which the special attention of capitalist Europe is focused. At the same time, in terms of the ethnic composition of the population and culture, Azerbaijan is in close connection with Persia and Turkey. It is understandable, therefore, why the government of the USSR attaches such great importance to the building of national culture on the new Soviet base in the ASSR. After all, the imperialist states of Europe are interested in Persia and Turkey only from the point of view of the possibility of exploiting these countries as semi-colonies; they carry there economic and political enslavement, which is a heavy burden on the working masses of the population. The imperialists incite national enmity in the East, so that the easier it is to consolidate their rule there. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is a natural friend of the people of the East, a friend who shows them the way to genuine liberation from foreign oppression. In particular, only the Soviet government was able to resolve the national question in Transcaucasia and thereby eliminate the difficult legacy of the tsarist government. In the same way, the emancipation of women, which is one of the most important tasks of cultural construction in the East, was put on solid foundations only under Soviet rule. a fairly large country: it stretches from north to south, along the shores of the Caspian Sea for 400 versts and 200 versts deep into the Caucasus, from east to west. Most of Azerbaijan is filled with mountains; along the entire length of the country passes the Main Caucasian ridge, from which numerous lower ridges branch off; only along the sea coast stretches a not very wide plain, sometimes completely disappearing, sometimes expanding by 30-40 versts. Not far from the Persian borders, this plain wedges into the mountains with a long tongue along the valley of the largest river in the Caucasus, the Kura, which at this point flows into the Caspian Sea; this plain along the lower course of the Kura is called the Mugan steppe and is the richest territory in which cotton is very good at birth. The seaside plain is the hottest part of Azerbaijan; here for at least half a year — from May to October there is a strong heat. This hot plain is partly covered with lush vegetation, but for the most part it is a dry steppe and even a real desert <scorched by the sun, devoid of fresh water; the wells dug here collect salt water. Rough mountain rivers, running down from the snowy mountains to the sea, cross this plain in some places, and these areas are covered with rich vegetation. The forests are especially luxurious in the very south of Azerbaijan, near the borders of Persia, in the region of the seaside town of Lankaran. Mugan steppe is rather wide, especially closer to the sea; here the flat steppe spreads for several tens of versts. These places are rainless and during 3-4 summer months, another year, not a drop of rain will fall; river water irrigates only a narrow strip along the banks, and in the rest of the steppe everything burns out from the scorching summer sun; only the wind drives clouds of dust, and numerous snakes, lizards and all kinds of insects live and breed in the open. But in the winter half of the year, the Mugan steppe comes to life, low grass begins to turn green. Give in the summer here you can grow various useful plants that love strong sun and heat, for example, cotton; only canals should be diverted from the river and sown fields should be irrigated with them; these works require a lot of funds, but the costs are repaid a hundredfold; Therefore, the Soviet government is currently paying great attention to these works. In the mountainous part of Azerbaijan, numerous ridges run up, all the way up, to the Main Caucasian ridge covered with eternal snow and ice. The first rows of mountains are usually covered with dense forests; lower these forests are deciduous, on high ridges deciduous forests disappear and are replaced by conifers, even higher, near the snow, the forests completely disappear and here in the summer there are vast meadows covered with tall and luxurious grass, and even higher, all year round, everything is covered with snow and ice. In the mountains of Azerbaijan there is a long severe winter with snow and frost, and spring, and hot summer with rains and thunderstorms, and a rainy autumn. Such is the diversity of nature in different parts of Azerbaijan, and, of course, economic activities and everyday life of the population develop in different ways in different parts of the country. Azerbaijan is inhabited mainly by Turks or Tatars, accounting for about 56% of the total population; the remaining 40% are mainly Armenians (13%), Russians (7%), Persians and mountain tribes. Azerbaijani Turks are the closest relatives of Anatolian Turks; their language is also similar to Turkish, as, say, Great Russian to Ukrainian; the Crimean and Kazan Tatars are also the closest relatives of the Azerbaijani Turks. All these peoples have preserved great similarities in their way of life; all of them profess the Muslim religion, which still retains a strong influence among the dark masses. The main occupations of the Azerbaijani Turks are agriculture and cattle breeding. Before the Soviet coup, that is, until May 1920, about 20% of the best land belonged to the "beks" and "khans", the Turkic landowners who cruelly exploited the backward peasant masses. They levied all kinds of semi-feudal extortions from both farmers and herders; they often had a crowd of armed servants of the "nukers" and kept the surrounding villages at bay. These feudal relations were liquidated only after the establishment of Soviet power in Azerbaijan; at present, the Azerbaijani peasantry has quite stratified on the one hand, we observe a significant layer of strong farms, especially in areas of intensive crops (rice and orchards), where the profitability of the peasant farm is especially high; on the other hand, one can state a noticeable influx of proletarianized and semi-proletarianized Turkic peasantry into the cities (mainly in Baku); thus, we are currently witnessing the birth and initial development of the Turkic industrial proletariat. As for the countryside, there continues to exist, along with large kulak farms, and middle and poor farms; The conditions of the climate, soil and cultivated plants (for example, cotton in Mugan) allow these farms to firmly exist and develop, especially with the support of the agricultural cooperation "Azsoyuz". In Azerbaijan, the features of a nomadic cattle-breeding life are still preserved. All the Turkic peoples in the distant past roamed the boundless steppes of Asia, engaged in cattle breeding; part of the Azerbaijani Turks living in the dry coastal steppes and on Mugan still retained this way of life. Their main wealth is livestock, mainly small horned ones, the so-called "baranta"; they spend the winter half of the year in their winter camps "kishlags" on the coastal steppe lowland; in winter, under the influence of rains, rare fresh grass appears here, on which, although very scarcely, cattle can graze. Life is hard at this time of the year for the Turkic herders; they live in houses, somehow made of stones and clay; these houses are mostly without windows and consist of one room, if you can only call a small, low and dirty barn a room, where sometimes animals are placed with people; In the wet and cold weather, which so often happens in winter, all family members huddle in the saklya (the so-called living quarters in the Azerbaijani village) and spend many days in crowded and stuffy weather. There are no stoves in saklyas, and in one of the corners there is a fireplace, in which a fire is made, and the smoke goes out through the chimney; there is no firewood in the steppe and they are burning "dung", dried manure, and there is more smoke than fire; over the fire, like over a fire, pots are hung in which food is cooked, and here everyone is heated and dried. They eat very poorly in winter: "churek", thin and flat barley bread, and sheep's cheese; meat is seldom eaten on special occasions. All household work is carried out mainly by women: they look after the cattle and bake bread in "tandoor" - holes in the ground, at the bottom of which a fire is made and the walls are coated with clay; dough is glued to the walls, which is baked; they also make yarn, and fabric, and a dress for men - from sheep's wool. Men sometimes go with caravans to the city, but spend most of their time in idleness and in endless conversations with each other. But at the end of December or in January, men take up a home-made wooden plow, plow the neighboring rice. 1. Dwelling in a dry foothill strip with slag plots of steppe and sown with barley; by the end of April or in May, the barley usually ripens, and if the sowing does not burn out from the sun, which happens very often, then a meager harvest is removed. The Turkic cattle-breeder does not particularly count on this harvest; such agriculture is just an auxiliary occupation for him. But now the hard winter passes, the sun starts to heat up strongly, and in April the steppe turns green, but only for a very short time; in early May the grass burns out, and the cattle again have nothing to eat. Then all the villages are empty; each saklya loads all their belongings onto carts (2-wheeled carts harnessed by bulls or buffaloes) and set off for the mountains, where luxurious mountain meadows stretch near the snow. It is here that the pastoralists settle down for their summer living; men again indulge in complete idleness, and women are busy with the procurement of dairy products, which they will sell in the autumn to city buyers. This is how the life of the Turkic nomadic pastoralists proceeds, in their annual movements from the steppe plains to the high mountains and vice versa. Agricultural villages are located on the slopes of the mountains. At the very bottom, where it begins to slope up to the mountains, in the vicinity of a fast mountain river, there are vast rice fields, or "chaltyks", as they are called in Azerbaijan. Rice is a marsh plant in hot countries; crops must emerge under water, so rice fields are flooded for quite a long time; they are located along the slope, and water is diverted from mountain rivers by ditches, from which small grooves branch off, leading water to different parts of the field. The work to maintain this entire irrigation network requires a lot and very hard. All this hard agricultural work is done almost exclusively by women. The villages themselves are usually located near rice fields. In these villages, there are small orchards, and mulberry trees are planted near the houses and, again, women are engaged in silkworm breeding. Men, on the other hand, play the role of the main leaders of the economy and do very little field work; when the time comes for the sale of the harvest and other products of the economy, then the owner becomes a merchant, and for some time he has a great deal of care; but the days of trouble pass, and again the heads of farms and families gather in groups, drink strong tea, and, sucking on the shanks, have endless conversations. 

2. A group of Azerbaijani peasant women. High in the mountains, village life develops differently. Barley fields are sown around the village on more level ground; the harvest from them, as in the RSFSR, is removed not earlier than the middle of summer, and men also take part in agricultural work. They plow here with the most primitive plow, often made of two crossing branches; metal plows are rare. And other agricultural implements have survived unchanged from ancient times. But not only barley fields are the main wealth of the inhabitants in mountain villages; around the auls, in large areas, there are orchards, in which apples, pears, cherries, and quince grow as huge trees; many thousands of poods of various fruits are collected in autumn by each aul in these orchards, and these fruits are of very high quality. The lion's share of the labor of both tending the orchards and collecting fruit falls on women; they are also engaged in the procurement of dried fruits. But the mountain villages of Azerbaijan are famous not only for their fruits. Excellent carpets are made here by female hands. The extraordinary durability of colors, the beauty of their combinations and patterns brought world fame to these carpets. The main, absolutely predominant, urban center of Azerbaijan is, of course, Baku, with its almost half a million population and powerful industry. More than 100,000 mass of the proletariat is concentrated in Baku, and 44.5% of this proletariat is Russian. Strong isolation from the countryside contributed to the development of class self-awareness in it, and the Baku workers have always been at the forefront of the Russian labor movement. The first attempts at organized demonstrations date back to 1990, the 19th century, and in 1899, social democratic propaganda began among the Baku workers, which had significant success. The May Day demonstration of 1903 was attended by up to 10,000 workers, and in July of the same year a general strike broke out in Baku, which opened a new page in the Russian labor movement; in 1904, the second general strike, which led the workers to victory and to the partial recognition of their professional organization by the employers. From that time on, the strikes took on a revolutionary character: the organization of the Baku proletariat grew so much that not only entrepreneurs began to reckon with it, but in 1906–07. even the tsarist government. The subsequent years of reaction were unable to destroy the professional organization of the Baku workers, but only somewhat weakened it in 1913 and 1914. two grandiose general strikes flared up again, of a strikingly revolutionary character; the strike of 1914 was broken only by the outbreak of the world war. Between the end of 1918 and April 1920, during the domination of the national-bourgeois power of the Mussavat party in Azerbaijan, the Baku proletariat realized its class task and entered into a struggle against the Mussavat government, which relied on the imperialist bayonets of the British. The Baku workers maintained contact with Soviet Russia through Astrakhan; there were a lot of brave workers from among them, who delivered gasoline to Astrakhan on sailing boats by sea, breaking the blockade of the Denikin-British fleet; thanks to this assistance, the operation of airplanes and motor vehicles became possible in the Red Army. Many of these heroes died at their posts. Workers of the Baku coastal radio station kept in touch with Astrakhan and Moscow, every minute they risked being shot as spies. And when at the end of April 1920 the Red Army was still almost 200 versts from Baku, the Baku proletariat under the leadership of the Communist Party overthrew the power of the Mussavat government and on the radio asked the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR for help. Thus, thanks to the revolutionary organization of the Baku workers, Azerbaijan easily reunited with the Soviet Union. And during the years of revolutionary devastation, the Baku proletariat, under the leadership of engineers and workers' leaders closely united with it, quickly rebuilt the oil industry, realizing the enormity of the responsibility that lay on it. Now, alongside the Russian proletariat, the Turkic proletariat is gradually growing, which, joining the revolutionary traditions of the Baku workers, will revolutionize the life of the backward Turkic masses. The completion of this process is a matter for the future, but for now we are present at its very beginning. The county towns of Azerbaijan are small centers with a Turkic, predominantly, population. Often these towns are drowned in the greenery of luxurious orchards, which are the income of residents; nevertheless, their main economic base is small and medium-sized trade, which covers a fairly significant area of ​​neighboring auls. Such horticultural and shopping centers are Cuba, Shemakha, Nukha, Geokchay, Shusha, etc., and each of these cities is a base for agricultural cooperation. Mountains differ from these county towns. Ganja, the main industrial center of Azerbaijan after Baku. There are a number of factories for processing agricultural raw materials, and at present the government of the ASSR is building a large textile factory in Ganja. The bulk of the Ganja workers are the Turks, and the further development of Ganja as an industrial center will greatly contribute to the growth of the Turkic proletariat. As we can see, the Turkic urban population consists mainly of strata of the petty and middle bourgeoisie, in a certain respect even more inert than the peasantry; chador, for example, very little used in villages, is a law in urban centers. The cultural level of the Turkic mass is very low: literate in the village 2-30 / 0, in cities this percentage rises to 10-13%, women are illiterate by almost 100 %
